# PRD: Accounts UX (Desktop + Mobile)

## Goals
- Accounts list: scannable, sortable, and actionable.
- Account details: clear breakdown and recent activity.
- Mobile: fast switching between accounts without deep navigation.

## Key surfaces
- `app/accounts/*`
- `components/accounts/*` (if present)
- Repository-driven totals displayed in Header/Dashboard.

## Success metrics
- User can find an account in < 3 seconds.
- Account actions are one-tap reachable on mobile.
