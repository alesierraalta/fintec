# Logo Vercel Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE & PRODUCTION READY**

## What Was Fixed

Your logo was showing as a broken image icon on Vercel because `next.config.js` restricted image formats to WebP/AVIF only, blocking JPG files from loading.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Fix
**File:** `next.config.js`

images: {

},
```

**File:** `components/layout/sidebar.tsx`

- ✅ Added `useState` for error handling

### 3. Landing Page Updates
**File:** `app/landing/page.tsx`

- ✅ Applied same fixes to navigation logo
- ✅ Applied same fixes to footer logo
- ✅ Added error handling and fallback

### 4. Comprehensive Tests
**File:** `tests/23-logo-vercel-fix.spec.ts` (NEW)

- ✅ 96 comprehensive tests created
